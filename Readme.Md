#Scenic App
This is app is a platform for users to post photos they've taken and share them with fellow users similar to Tumblr/Instagram. Intended to be geared more towards landscape and nature photography, to stray away from the typical shallow minded / self obsessed user behavior. aka Selfies

I would like to see it evolve into an app where users can post the photo, then provide detailed intstuctions as to how to find that location. Users will link a geo tag or provide easter egg hunt style instructions to re-create that scenic photo. I hope to then allow users to earn points for finding a marked location in the app. Providing incentive and possibly rewards for frequent usage.

#Technologies Used
Ruby, Rails, JS, CSS, HTML, Git, Heroku, Gems, Google Maps API, Bootsrap

Started by making Posts model/ controller/ views. Followed by Users. Then I used a paperclip gem to allow photo posting. Then I made sessions controller/ views and used simple form for logins. Used Bootsrap for my navbar/ drop down and my custom login form.
